# Multithreaded-programming-example-2
A program that uses the concept of thread pools, callabls, futures <br/>

Implemented a program that demonstrates the principle of multi-threaded programming, and concurrent objects. The program processes real weather data from 1,200 files each file contains data form different weather stations in the United State for one month days in each station. The program creates 10 threads each thread processes a random number of files in parallel and finds 5 absolute lowest or highest temperatures recorded in a given range of years and months. About 80% of the processing is done in parallel.
